  "setup_steps": [
    "1. Sign up at viz.greynoise.io",
    "2. Community tier: Free — limited queries/day",
    "3. Enterprise tier: Full API access, bulk queries, GNQL",
    "4. Get API key from Account Settings → API Key",
    "5. Install: pip install greynoise (or use uvx for MCP)"

  "use_cases": [
    "Incident response — is this attacking IP a known mass scanner or targeted?",
    "Alert triage — reduce false positives by filtering known-benign scanners",
    "Threat hunting — find IPs scanning for specific CVEs",
    "Vulnerability prioritisation — is this CVE being actively exploited at scale?"
